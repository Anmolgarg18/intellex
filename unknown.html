I've proposed two innovative approaches this quarter for our medical education strategy, though I sometimes hesitate when there's significant uncertainty or potential for failure. I recognize that my analytical nature sometimes leads me to over-analyze decisions rather than acting decisively on opportunities. I'm actively seeking opportunities to develop in this area, particularly by observing colleagues who demonstrate effective risk-taking and by practicing in lower-stakes situations. I believe developing greater boldness would help me drive more innovative approaches in our Medical Affairs activities and ultimately create greater value for patients and the organization."</p>
